# Html_Css_Jss-Blogy
This is my blog work for the week, i started from scratch and i decided to choose HTML/CSS with JavaScript as my Tool.
This site is already hosted and you can visite it on https://miandryrakoto.github.io/Html_Css_Jss-Blogy  ,but it takes a little time to load due to the quality of the photos.
